	<h4>The Problem</h4>
	<p>
	The internet is a fast growing resource that in current days no matter the age, everyone is exposed to. The world wide web has changed the way society acceses knowlege, its become an asset to everyone and increased the amount of knowledge someone is able to obtain in a life time due to the ulimited information available. However the internet is growing rapidly and EVERYTHING on the web is perminant. The problem is that a lot of poeple, especially young people are completly unaware of this. Everyday children all around the world are making uneducated desisions on their social networks without knowing the perminant consequences.
